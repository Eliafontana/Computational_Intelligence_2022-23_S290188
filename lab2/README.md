# Lab 2 (First implementation)
Set covering solved using Genetic algorithm 
* Fitness based on a priority tuple (num. of elements covered, num. of repetitions)
* Parent selection: tournament selection
* Mutation: both replacement and removing of a random locus (the mutation type is selected randomly)
* Crossover: single cut point for each genome
